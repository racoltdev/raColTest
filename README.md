<h1>raColTest</h1>
raColTest is a unit testing library made for and in C.
It is intended to be an extension of existing build systems, providing some CICD capabilities such as automated logging and notifying the build system of pass/fail. raColTest is independent of any specific build system and can be integrated into any existing C project.
